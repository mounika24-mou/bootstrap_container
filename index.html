                <h1 class="font-weight-bold ">MIND HACKS</h1>
                <p class="border border-dark "> Mind Hacks was originally a book about neuroscience and psychology. 
                It was written by Tom Stafford and Matt Webb, and published by O’Reilly. 
                The Guardian called it “fascinating” and Blogcritics said it was a “rewarding mind trop that stretches the boundaries of what we know.”
                The blog version of Mind Hacks continues to share the author’s musings with the world. Similar to the book,
                 it is a “collection of probes into the moment-by-moment workings of our brain.” 
                 It seeks to help people understand themselves better by learning what makes people think and tick.
            </p>
           
         
        <p class="border border-primary  bg-info "> Stafford and Webb cover a variety of topics in this blog, including psychology news, book reviews, 
         and relevant videos connected to psychology. If you visit their blog and read an article or two, you might just find yourself hooked, 
         as their writing style is very articulate and persuasive. The blog is also regularly updated, so there is always fresh content.</p>

         <h1 class="font-weight-bold ">PSYBLOG</h1>
        <p class="border  border-danger bg-warning text-dark border-bottom-0">PsyBlog usually covers topics on self-improvement, habit changes, happiness, and mental health. 
        It is not your usual how-to or why-is blog, as it mostly focuses on peer-reviewed research studies. 
        Dr. Dean has a master’s degree in research methods in psychology, so he is very fond of knowledge-based articles and reports.

        If you check the site, you will also find tons of articles about physical and physiological health.
         They are typically about how the human body reacts under different psychological states.
         There are also articles that are completely separate from psychology.</p>

            <p class=" border font-weight-bold border-success border-top-0"> IQ’s Corner is a technical blog that mostly consists of research and case studies. 
                If you enjoy scientific research, then this could be a great fit. 
                The blog’s main purpose is to explore the link between “intelligence theory and the applied practice of intelligence testing.”
                 Dr. McGrew’s interest lies in the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) Theory of Human Cognitive Abilities,
                  and how all other CHC assessment types emerge from it. He aims to find the ultimate answer to 
                  how cognitive intelligence affects our day-to-day activities and accomplishments.</p>
